      </a>SVN builds are versions of dosbox.exe that people have built from the latest version of the DOSBox source code, which is stored on sourceforge.net in something called a SVN repository. SVN builds contain changes that have been made by Qbix and Harekiet since the latest official release. Some enhanced SVN builds also contain unofficial features and fixes that have been created by enthusiasts in the DOSBox development community.
