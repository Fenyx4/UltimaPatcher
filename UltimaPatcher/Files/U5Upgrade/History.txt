Project Status:

	08-21-2001 - Release 1.0:

	This is the first full release of the U5 MIDI Upgrade.  This is
	all the stuff that I added:

	- The game plays "Ultima Theme" to the main menu.

	- I added various songs from U5 to the Introduction and Endgame
	  sequences.  I tried to choose songs that best fit the sequences.

	- The Character Creation sequence plays the Amiga music.

	- The game plays the Apple II / Commodore 128 arrangement of songs
	  in their appropriate places in the game.  I received most of this
	  information from playing parts of these versions on an emulator and
	  from other Dragons on news:rec.games.computer.ultima.dragons.

	- I made sure that Death and the Blackthorn capture sequence were both
	  handled properly: no music should be playing during these sequences.

	- Some people are not aware that you can Exit to DOS using "CTL-E"
	  during the game.  Unfortunately, you cannot use it all the time, for
	  example, during combat or dungeon rooms which is a big disadvantage.
	  While I hope to add that capability in a future release, and perhaps
	  even a restore feature, I did add the ability to exit in three key
	  places of the game:  the main menu (with CTL-E), the last scene of
	  the endgame sequence (with any key), and the "bad" ending.  (the one
	  if you tell LB "no" -- again with any key)

	- Since the Tandy video driver is no longer in use, I used that as a
	  good place to store the name of the midi driver, MID.DRV.  This is
	  included in DATA.OVL, where all the game data is stored, and this is
	  the only update that needs to be made to that file.  To conserve zip
	  file size and reduce the amount of original game files that I am
	  including in this package, I've decided to write a separate patch,
	  "U5DATA.EXE" which will make this update for you.  Please execute
	  this before you begin the game or the MIDI will not work.

	- The MIDI files have been enhanced and suited to the game setting for
	  their appropriate scenes.  I have also improved most of the MIDI
	  files such that they loop more smoothly.

	Please see below for an abbreviated project history or visit the
	project website (http://exodus.voyd.net/) for the complete status
	history.  I also post relevant information on project updates to
	the rec.games.computer.ultima.series and .dragons newsgroups.


Known Issues:

	Beware, this gets technical.

	If you let the game sit at the demonstration sequence on the main
	menu screen (where the introduction is pretty much acted out in tile
	graphics), and the "Ultima Theme" music ends, it will not loop back
	to the beginning.  The reason for this is that I refresh the music
	during each int 16h call (which essentially checks for another key
	press).  In the demonstration, the int 16h call is made in the EGA
	driver, which is the only part of the game that checks for keypresses
	in the driver.  Thus, it is the only part of the game affected.  The
	reason why this is a problem is because the ega driver is in a different
	code segment from the rest of the game, so it cannot make function calls
	back the functions that I wrote in ULTIMA.EXE.  There are, as usual,
	other ways around this, but I am looking for the least messy.  ;)
