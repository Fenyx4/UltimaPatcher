1 - Disclaimer:

	Please note that Ultima is a registered trademark of Origin
	Systems, Inc (OSI), which is now a part of EA Games.  This
	project is not affiliated with nor endorsed by OSI/EA.  You
	must own a legal copy of Ultima V: Warriors of Destiny in
	order to apply this patch.


2 - Project Scope:

	The goal of this project is to convert Ultima V: Warriors of
	Destiny for the PC, a game from 1987, up to newer standards.
	The first phase of this project will be to add MIDI music to
	the game, something that is sorely missed in the PC version
	of the game.

	As it turns out, the U5 version on different platforms played
	different songs at different times.  The Apple II / Commodore
	128 versions were the most widely available, so the first
	version of the upgrade will make use of that particular
	arrangement of songs.  The Atari ST version, however, while
	still using the same set of songs, played those songs at
	different points in the game.  For example, the song "Villager
	Terantella" is played in all eight Cities of Virtue in the
	C128/AppleII versions, but the Atari ST version instead plays
	"Greyson's Tale" in all but New Magincia.  I hope to release
	a version that adds the Atari ST interpretation of the game
	music as well.

	It also turns out that the Amiga version plays only one entirely
	different song altogether throughout the entire game.  Although
	I have no plans to add the Amiga flavor to the update (unless
	it is requested by enough folks) I have decided to include the
	song itself in the character creation process.  Hey, it's a nice
	tune.  ;)

	At present, Phase I is complete with a known issue or two.  The
	Upgrade itself, however, is in maintenance mode.  This means that
	the package is stable and fairly complete.  I will resolve bugs
	as they are pointed out to me.

	Sometime in the future, I may add VGA support (256-color) to
	this upgrade.  As I am a tech and not a graphic artist, that
	phase will require the participation of others.

6 - Credits:

	Thanks to the Ultima Dragons of rgcud for, well, just being the
	outspoken group that they are.

	And thanks especially to Richard Garriot for leaving the early PC
	Ultima games without music, thus inspiring me to learn assembly.  ;)
