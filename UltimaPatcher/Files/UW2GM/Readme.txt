Welcome to the Ultima Underworld 2: Labyrinth
Of Worlds General MIDI Patch V1.0 by SkyGracer 
		    aka
	    Panzer Dragon (UDIC).


(i)-<(What does this GM Patch do?)>-

This patch is designed to replace the existing
music files for Ultima Underworld 2 with new
optimised GM files.

A while ago I just got my new PCI S3 SonicVibes
wavetable card and was eager to play Underworld
with General MIDI. Alas, the GM option was not
available and it only offered Roland LAPC/MT32
emulation. UW worked but the music was terrible!
The existing XMIs (eXtended MIdi files) were
optimised for Roland LAPC/MT32 and not for GM, 
so obviously they sound a bit queer. This patch
is for those who have GM cards such as AWE32/64.
I replaced the original XMIs with optimised MIDI
files.


(ii)-<(What this patch DOESN'T do:)>-

This patch is only for GM cards and therefore
little or no difference will occur whilst using
a FM synthesis card such as Adlib, SB16, SB Pro.
I did NOT touch the digital sound samples, though
I could, upon request however. I thought the sound
FX were quite fine the way they presently are so
I won't spoil them. NOTE: Using this patch, you
will no longer allow you to use the original XMIs
(is that really a bad thing? <G>). This patch also
won't make you a sex magnet or bring world peace.


(iii)-<(Installation)>-

This patch is very simple to install. Merely
unzip this archive into your Ultima Underworld 2
SOUND directory (eg C:\UW2\SOUND) and when the
archive prompts you to replace the existing files
answer YES for all of them. After that, run the
Setup file (UINSTALL.EXE) and select Roland LAPC.
Next time you run UW, the music will sound better.

NOTE: If you wish to revert back to the original
music files, merely copy the XMI files from your
original UW2 CD and overwrite the new XMI files.
Best to backup your files beforehand.


(iv)-<(Compatibility)>-

Theoretically, if you could run Underworld before
this patch, it should work fine after as well. It
doesn't exactly change that much <G>. But FYI, I
included the system which I ran this on:

 P100(Oh stop laughing!), 32MB EDO, 1.2GB HDD 
4X CDROM, S3 SonicVibes PCI GM compatible Soundcard

I've tested this patch under the following:

DOS 6.22
Worked fine! Remember to use EMS. Otherwise,
not a single problem.

Windows95
Remember to run in Full Screen Mode
and to have EMS configured. I couldn't get
speech to run under Win95. Probably because of
my soundcard's fussyness and lack of support.


If there are any problems with this patch. Give me
a yell and tell me your system configuration/specs.
But seriously, I think this should have no effect
on Underworld, compatibility/stability wise.


(v)-<(Problems/Other Stuff)>-

There should be no problems with installation/use
of this patch. If the music doesn't sound right,
then it's probably just your soundcard that is the
actual problem <G>. If you wish to change the sound
FX, it is up to you, I will make no such effort 
unless popular demand makes me reconsider <G>.
