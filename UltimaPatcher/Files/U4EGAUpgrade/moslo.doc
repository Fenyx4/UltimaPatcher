				Mo'Slo v.1.1
			Copyright (c) David Perrell 1990

Mo'Slo allows you to slow the speed of your computer to 1-99% of normal in
1% increments. To use it, you supply the program you want to run slow as a
commandline argument. Slowness is adjusted via a command line switch. If
the switch is not supplied, Mo'Slo slows your computer to 4.77MHz PC/XT
speed. 

Mo'Slo doesn't check the environment for path statements. You must give it
the complete filename to be run, including extension, and a path if the
file isn't in the current directory. 
      
To run pcgame.com or pcgame.exe at IBM PC/XT speed, type: 

moslo pcgame.com
                   
To run at 5% normal speed, type: 

moslo /5 pcgame.com
                   
To run a game that you type "START" to play, at 50% its speed

moslo /50 start.exe

(.COM OR .EXE EXTENSION MUST BE INCLUDED. You may also include commandline
arguments to the program being called.)

When you exit pcgame, you'll exit Mo'Slo, and normal speed will be
restored. (Mo'Slo doesn't affect the system clock -- it keeps on tickin'.)

Mo'Slo will not slow a computer below its ability to operate. For a
4.77MHz PC/XT, 5% is minimum. A 25MHz machine will run (crawl) at 1%. 

Mo'Slo without argument (or bad argument) gets you instructions. 

Mo'Slo is free of charge for private, personal use. (If you think of a way
to make some money with it, I'd like a cut.) It works for me, but I do not
warrant it in any way. USE Mo'Slo AT YOUR OWN RISK. 

Mo'Slo requires PC/MS-DOS 2.0 or above. 

Got a programming project for Intel 8'86 CPUs that requires elegant design
and efficient implementation? Crave a utility that doesn't seem to exist?
I'd like to hear from you.
