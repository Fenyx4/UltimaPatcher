INTRODUCTION
------------

I'm Joshua Clayton Steele, also known as Wiltshire Dragon
of the Ultima Dragons. Hello, and welcome to my new EGA
graphics for Ultima IV. If you're using CGA to play, I pity
you but have no plans to mess with those. Purple and Cyan
give me a headache, especially when dithered.

Oh yeah, you must already own the IBM/compatible version
of Ultima IV by Origin Systems, Inc. to use this. I have
no intention of distributing a copyrighted work thank you
very much.

VERSION HISTORY (What's new in each release?)
---------------
1.7     09-29-97
PARTY.EXE! It's done! So you can all stop bugging me about
it. =) Run it from DOS or Windows. Doesn't matter. It'll
go full screen. ENJOY! (As you can see, I beat my October
1st deadline. It's a computer industry first.)

1.5     05-xx-97
If you've already started a game, everything is now new to
you, including the entire endgame. I've also rethought my
Phantom Tile, Border Graphics, and Full Avatarhood.
I have also created perhaps the most ridiculous Gremlin
in the history of Ultima. I hope you like these better,
as they are now "final". Disk compression of graphics is in.

1.21    04-xx-97	
Whoops. 1.2's changega.bat had the rune_3 section repeated so
was effectively renaming it then renaming it back. Fixed it.
By the way, what does this say?

    PARIS IN
  IN THE SPRING

=)

1.2     04-xx-97
The Avatar's Visions! Now, when you achieve partial
Avatarhood or do anything else that would cause a
graphical vision (clue) to appear in the map window,
you're in for a dose of EGA eye-candy.

1.1     Hmmm...
Not a whole hell of a lot, really.
I added the first draft of the border graphics.
I fixed the little annoyance of your party icon being
a musical note in a dungeon (p)eer. Now it's a Red Shield(TM),
but it really looks more like a jellybean or something.
OH WELL.

1.0     I can't remember back this far.
The Meat.
Tiles and font are completely redrawn!

WHAT'S LEFT
-----------

Title stuff & Animation. The gypsy wagon & carnival.
The virtue "tarot" cards. The abacus. In other words,
everything that happens when you select "Initiate
New Game". These will be included in the final (2.0)
release. Along with some secret stuff.

FILE DESCRIPTIONS
-----------------

readme.bat   - If you don't know by now...
readme.txt   - This file.

moslo.com    - v1.1 by David Perrell. If you have a newer version, good
               for you. Slows down your computer to run old stuff.
moslo.doc    - Docs for mo'slo.
               **Thanks DP, for a great utility.

changega.bat - "Switches" the graphics and font from Origin's to mine
               and vice-versa. A batch file.

               your party icon in the actual game.
party.ico    - It's so fresh it has its own icon. 

gpack.ega    - Flag file needed for party.exe. Don't mess with it.

INSTRUCTIONS
------------

GENERAL:

OK, pay attention:
-2) You should have unzipped these files into your Ultima IV directory,
    wherever that happens to be. If not, get them there.
-1) Play around with the game for a couple minutes, especially if you
    haven't touched it in years, just to get an idea of the "before"
    shot. Use moslo to start it up or it'll probably run a little too
    zippy for you.
 0) Quit the game. Since there's no way to really quit to DOS you'll
    either have to reboot or hit the Windows95 key & end the task or
    whatever. You get the idea.

 1) Execute changega.bat by typing it on the command line or double-
    clicking it in whatever GUI you're using.
 2) Play the game again using moslo, and ENJOY. May thou complete the
    Quest of the Avatar and love it, pal.

FOR PARTY.EXE:
 1) Make sure MY graphics are active. (See above instructions)
 2) Run party.exe the best way you know how.
 3) Use the arrow keys to move and the 'Q' key to quit prematurely.
    Other instructions will be displayed onscreen.
 *) Feel free to try other things... ;)
 5) Enter the gate to save your selection and exit.

MY INTENTIONS & SOMEWHAT LEGAL THINGS
-------------------------------------

I decided to make an Ultima IV style game several years ago,
so I set about writing a simple tile graphics program. Imagine
my surprise when I discovered that my program was compatible
with shapes.ega! So, I abandoned the game idea and started
drawing. It was done. Then my HD crashed. Whoops, no backup.
I started over but didn't get very far. Years pass...
Some Ultima Dragons express interest in the project.
I finish it... eventually.

I will not expect, desire, or accept any $donations for this
work (unless it's from Origin :) ) My intention is for these
graphics to spark some new interest in Ultima IV, so perhaps
those who have played it will enjoy it again, and others will
have a new reason to purchase it on compilation CD-ROM.

I am in no way affiliated with OSI, other than by writing my
college entrance essay about Richard Garriott (yes, I did
get in, and am on the 8-year plan.) While my chances for ever
working at OSI are slim to none, I am grateful for this
chance to make a little hunk of Ultima.

This upgrade is provided "as is", thus I will take zero
responsibility if you should happen to screw up your computer
while using it.

Please send comments and criticisms (such as: "Why does the rat
look like a kitten?") to avatar@udel.edu. That's me. I will
do my best to keep the file updated if necessary. l8r.
