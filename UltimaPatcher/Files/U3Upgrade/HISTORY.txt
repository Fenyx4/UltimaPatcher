        ****************************


Project Status:

    12-19-2016 - Release 3.2:

        This release adds perhaps the most common request I've received
        over the years: improved PC-speaker sound effects.  More
        specifically, the sound effects are now timed and should sound
        mostly consistent with the original intent.

        Ultima 3's sound effects where designed to sound great on a
        4.77 MHz 8086, but do not scale well as CPU speed increases.
        This is because the game code directly manipulates the PC
        speaker without being hooked to any kind of timer.  Thus, as the
        CPU frequency (or VM speed) increases, the faster the PC speaker
        oscillates which makes the sound not only shorter but also
        higher pitched.

        In this latest patch, if the SFXTIMED driver is configured, the 
        sound effects will now be paced against a timer interrupt.  It's
        recommended that you run DOSBOX at around 3000 cycles (or 9000 if
        using CGA Composite mode) to get a good playable experience.

        Some Additional Technical Notes:

        Note that DOSBOX needs to be above at least 1000 cycles for the timer to
        operate properly otherwise the timer interrupt will begin thrashing.
        This is because the interrupt routine will execute too slowly and
        never return before the next interrupt is fired, thus freezing
        the game.

    07-23-2014 - Release 3.1:

        This release adds a few gameplay fixes to the game and
        addresses a few issues/concerns folks had with version 3.0.

        - A set of gameplay fixes that can be enabled/disabled in the
          configuration program.  The fixes must be toggled as a group;
          they cannot be toggled individually.  If enabled, they will
          do the following:
          - Double the overworld monster generation rate.  Perhaps one
            of the largest complaints of this port of U3 is the low
            monster generation rate and, by extension, the ship
            generation rate.
          - Increase the dungeon monster generation rate.  Rate increase
            varies by level such that it is double the original on the
            first level, but only 25% more on the bottom level.  Note
            that the effective rate increases with each dungeon level.
            This results in more lucrative dungeon runs, but also
            potentially more dangerous.
          - Halve the food consumption rate.  Food is supposed to be
            taxing on a party, but weighs too heavily against poorer
            parties.
        - A streamlined installation procedure.  This package ships with
          default configuration for the most common or recommended
          settings.  You are of course free to customize it as needed,
          but it's no longer required.
        - Windows-native (32-bit) and Linux-native (i686 ELF) versions
          of the U3RESET, U3CFG, and BINPAT tools.  Windows versions
          end in "w" and Linux versions end in "l".  This should make it
          simpler to run these programs without having to boot into
          Dosbox and manually run them.  Sorry MacOS users - I'd love to
          have OSX native versions as well, but I don't have a great
          cross-compile solution to build Mac binaries from Windows.
        - The DOS 16-bit version of U3RESET was missing from the v3.0
          package.  It's included again now.
        - A bugfix where a resurrection would cause the game to crash.
        - A minor VGA graphics update to the dragon animation on startup.

    01-13-2011 - Release 3.0:

        After many years, the 3.0 release is finally available.
        The major feature of this release is its support for 256-
        color VGA graphics.

        It's worthwhile to note that the video and music code was
        entirely re-written and extracted into external drivers.
        This makes it easier for me to maintain, but also enabled
        the ability to "switch" between video modes with a config
        program by merely swapping drivers.

        In addition to the headline VGA graphics, users have the
        option of playing in EGA and CGA modes if they so choose.
        Furthermore, for "classic mode" enthusiasts, there is now
        a CGA Composite driver which simulates the blending of
        CGA colors on composite monitors.  This is actually how
        U3 on the IBM PC was intended to be played!  More info
        at https://sourceforge.net/p/ultima-exodus/wiki/CGA%20Composite/

        Besides the graphics drivers, a number of other things
        have been updated/added:

        - You can replace those 0-7 moon phase numbers with actual
          moon phase icons.  Make sure "moon phases" is set as
          "enabled" in the config.
        - The EXE programs included with the upgrade (U3CFG.EXE
          and U3RESET.EXE) have been recompiled to work properly
          under 16-bit DOS without a DPMI interface (e.g. DOS4GW).
        - A bug was fixed that would give inaccurate Marks/Cards
          information in Ztats.
        - The frame limiter was rewritten using the PIT (Programmable
          Interrupt Timer) as opposed to date milisecond comparisons.
          Some of the timings have been adjusted.
        - The Exodus Project is now open source!  Find us on
          SourceForge at the following URL:
          https://sourceforge.net/projects/ultima-exodus/

        Lastly, I no longer include the modified binaries in the
        release packages.  I found that as I modified more and
        more of the files in the Ultima games I was coming
        awefully close to including the entire game in the zip
        file.  Now, the release packages include a patch file that
        contains only the differences.  You'll need to use the
        binpat program to patch your executable and data files.
        There's more on this in the install instructions.

Known Issues:

    None at this time.


Abbreviated History:
