    to apply this patch.


2 - Project Scope:

    The goal of this project is to convert Ultima III: Exodus
    for the PC up to newer standards.

    The first phase of this project was to convert the legacy
    CGA (4-color) graphics to lesser-legacy EGA (16-color)
    graphics.  Let's face it: magenta, cyan, and grey were not
    exactly pleasing to the eye.  I conformed loosely to the
    C64 color scheme, and used some tiles from the PC versions
    of U1 & U4.  (As of v1.0, this phase is complete!)

    The second phase added MIDI music to the game. Many
    thanks go to Aradindae Dragon (co-author of the U4 MIDI
    Upgrade) for supplying me with the MIDI package in the
    first place.  (As of v2.0, this phase is complete!)

    The third phase of this project added VGA (256-color)
    graphics to the game.  Having a series of successes with
    other upgrade projects, I had learned quite a bit more
    about assembly language since I first started this hobby,
    so I modified the architecture to be more driver-oriented.
    This allows for easier maintenance and increased
    extensibility in the future.  It also enabled the addition
    of a driver to simulate CGA Composite mode.  (As of v3.0,
    this phase is complete!)

    Other goals that are not necessarily part of any particular
    phase include adding Quit and Restore hot keys, slowing
    down or controlling the game speed, and adding an
    option to disable the annoying "AutoSave" feature.  (As of
    v2.1, all these features have been added!)

    Future enhancements might entail modifying the sound effects
    to be generated by WAV/MP3 data, looking at using SVGA DOS
    libraries for higher-resolution graphics, and/or allowing others
    to more easily customize the graphics and music.  At the moment
    though, I feel the U3 Upgrade is in a very good spot where it is,
    so don't expect these things any time soon (or perhaps ever).


3 - Current Features:

    This is currently Release 3.2, which supports the following
    features:

        1) Fully colored VGA (256-color) tiles
        2) Fully colored EGA (16-color) tiles
        3) A Composite-mode CGA (16-color) simulation driver
           that operates on the CGA data; see more info at:
           https://sourceforge.net/p/ultima-exodus/wiki/CGA%20Composite/
        4) EGA/VGA/Composite dungeons are also in color
        5) Peer Gems yield a multi-colored look at the world
           map, versus only texture in the CGA, C64, and Apple
           II versions
        6) Restore (ALT-R), Exit (ALT-X), and Main Menu (ALT-M)
           hotkeys have been added to the game.  ALT-X is also
           supported while at the Main Menu.
        7) A Frame Limiter that eliminates the need for moslo
        8) Enhanced MIDI Music from the C64 and Apple II versions
        9) Ability to Enable/Disable the AutoSave feature
        10) Replaces the 0-7 moon phases with actual moon icons
        11) Gameplay balance fixes related to monster generation and
            food consumption rates.
        12) Timed PC speaker sound effects.


4 - Installation Instructions:

    1. The PC version of Ultima 3 must already be installed on
       your hard drive.  If you have a previous version of the U3
       Upgrade installed, you may:
        a) Replace it with a fresh copy of Ultima 3.  (be sure to
           back up your savegame files ROSTER.ULT and PARTY.ULT if
           you do)
        b) Alternatively, if upgrading from v3.1, you may uninstall
           it with one of the BINUNPAT commands:
                Windows:    binunpatw U3UP-31.PAT
                Linux:      ./binunpatl U3UP-31.PAT
                DOSBOX:     binunpat U3UP-31.PAT
           This will reverse the changes to the Ultima 3 binaries and
           restore it to its original 1980's state.
    2. Unzip the U3 Upgrade zip file into your Ultima 3 directory
       on your hard drive.  This step will not affect your current
       installation or saved games.
    3. Apply the binary patch to the game files.
            Windows:    binpatw U3UP-32.PAT
            Linux:      ./binpatl U3UP-32.PAT
            DOSBOX:     binpat U3UP-32.PAT
       This must be run from the command line.
    4. Configure DOSBOX to run with at least 3000 cycles.  (10000 if
       you intend to run using CGA Composite mode.)
    5. Run ULTIMA3.COM in DOSBOX to start the game.

    Optional steps:

    - This version ships with default configuration.  You can change
      this configuration in one of the following ways:
            Windows:    u3cfgw
            Linux:      ./u3cfgl
            DOSBOX:     u3cfg
      Modify them as you see fit and press 7 to save the configuration
      and exit.
    - This version ships with General MIDI as the default driver.  You
      can change this by running SETM.EXE from the Ultima 3 directory
      to configure a different sound card (e.g. FM synth).  This must
      be done within DOSBOX.
    - You can run reset the game map if you want your party to enter an
      uncharted Sosaria.  Your party must be dispersed in order to clear
      the map.  This program will not affect characters on the Roster.
            Windows:    u3resetw
            Linux:      ./u3resetl
            DOSBOX:     u3reset
