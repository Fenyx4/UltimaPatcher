[sdl]
#       fullscreen: Start dosbox directly in fullscreen. (Press ALT-Enter to go back)
#       fulldouble: Use double buffering in fullscreen. It can reduce screen flickering, but it can also result in a slow DOSBox.
#   fullresolution: What resolution to use for fullscreen: original or fixed size (e.g. 1024x768).
#                     Using your monitor's native resolution with aspect=true might give the best results.
#                     If you end up with small window on a large screen, try an output different from surface.
# windowresolution: Scale the window to this size IF the output device supports hardware scaling.
#                     (output=surface does not!)
#           output: What video system to use for output.
#                   Possible values: surface, overlay, opengl, openglnb, openglhq, ddraw, direct3d.
#         autolock: Mouse will automatically lock, if you click on the screen. (Press CTRL-F10 to unlock)
#      sensitivity: Mouse sensitivity.
#      waitonerror: Wait before closing the console if dosbox has an error.
#         priority: Priority levels for dosbox. Second entry behind the comma is for when dosbox is not focused/minimized.
#                     pause is only valid for the second entry.
#                   Possible values: lowest, lower, normal, higher, highest, pause.
#       mapperfile: File used to load/save the key/event mappings from. Resetmapper only works with the defaul value.
#      pixelshader: Pixelshader program (effect file must be in Shaders subdirectory).
#     usescancodes: Avoid usage of symkeys, might not work on all operating systems.

#  vmemsize: Amount of video memory in megabytes.
#              The maximum resolution and color depth the svga_s3 will be able to display
#              is determined by this value.

#            For build engine games, use more memory than in the list above so it can
#            use triple buffering and thus won't flicker.
#            
#  captures: Directory where things like wave, midi, screenshot get captured.
#   memsize: Amount of memory DOSBox has in megabytes.
#              This value is best left at its default to avoid problems with some games,
#              though few games might require a higher value.
#              There is generally no speed advantage when raising this value.
# memsizekb: Amount of memory DOSBox has in kilobytes.
#              This value should normally be set to 0.
#              If nonzero, overrides the memsize parameter.
#              Finer grained control of total memory may be useful in
#              emulating ancient DOS machines with less than 640KB of
#              RAM or early 386 systems with odd extended memory sizes.
#            
#  memalias: Memory aliasing emulation, in number of valid address bits.
#            . Many 386/486 class motherboards and processors prior to 1995
#              suffered from memory aliasing for various technical reasons. If the software you are
#              trying to run assumes aliasing, or otherwise plays cheap tricks with paging,
#              enabling this option can help. Note that enabling this option can cause slight performance degredation. Set to 0 to disable.
#              Recommended values when enabled:
#                24: 16MB aliasing. Common on 386SX systems (CPU had 24 external address bits)
#                    or 386DX and 486 systems where the CPU communicated directly with the ISA bus (A24-A31 tied off)
#                26: 64MB aliasing. Some 486s had only 26 external address bits, some motherboards tied off A26-A31

# frameskip: How many frames DOSBox skips before drawing one.
#    aspect: Do aspect correction, if your output method doesn't support scaling this can slow things down!.

#     char9: Allow 9-pixel wide text mode fonts.
# multiscan: Set this value to true to allow zooming gfx effects used in demos. It will disable several options such as scalers though.

#     cycles: Amount of instructions DOSBox tries to emulate each millisecond.
#             Setting this value too high results in sound dropouts and lags.
#             Cycles can be set in 3 ways:
#               'auto'          tries to guess what a game needs.
#                               It usually works, but can fail for certain games.
#               'fixed #number' will set a fixed amount of cycles. This is what you usually
#                               need if 'auto' fails (Example: fixed 4000).
#               'max'           will allocate as much cycles as your computer is able to
#                               handle.
#             Possible values: auto, fixed, max.
#  forcerate: Force the VGA framerate to a specific value, no matter what
#    cycleup: Amount of cycles to decrease/increase with keycombos.(CTRL-F11/CTRL-F12)

#    cgasnow: When machine=cga, determines whether or not to emulate CGA snow
# isapnpbios: Emulate ISA Plug & Play BIOS. Enable if using DOSBox to run a PnP aware DOS program or if booting Windows 9x.
#             Do not disable if Windows 9x is configured around PnP devices, you will likely confuse it.

#                        When using a Roland MT-32 rev. 0 as midi output device, some games may require a delay in order to prevent 'buffer overflow' issues.
#                        In that case, add 'delaysysex', for example: midiconfig=2 delaysysex

#                      Produces samples that exactly match the bits output from the emulated LA32.
#                      Nicer overdrive characteristics than the DAC hacks (it simply clips samples within range)
#                      Much less likely to overdrive than any other mode.
#                      Half the volume of any of the other modes, meaning its volume relative to the reverb
#                      output when mixed together directly will sound wrong. So, reverb level must be lowered.

#   multipage: Adds all pages to one Postscript file or printer job until CTRL-F2 is pressed.
#     docpath: The path where the output files are stored.
#     timeout: (in milliseconds) if nonzero: the time the page will

[parallel]
# parallel1: parallel1-3 -- set type of device connected to lpt port.
#            Can be:
#            	reallpt (direct parallel port passthrough),
#            	file (records data to a file or passes it to a device),
#            	printer (virtual dot-matrix printer, see [printer] section)
#            Additional parameters must be in the same line in the form of
#            parameter:value.
#              for reallpt:
#              Windows:
#                realbase (the base address of your real parallel port).
#                  Default: 378
#                ecpbase (base address of the ECP registers, optional).
#              Linux: realport (the parallel port device i.e. /dev/parport0).
#              for file: 
#                dev:<devname> (i.e. dev:lpt1) to forward data to a device,
#                or append:<file> appends data to the specified file.
#                Without the above parameters data is written to files in the capture dir.
#                Additional parameters: timeout:<milliseconds> = how long to wait before
#                closing the file on inactivity (default:500), addFF to add a formfeed when
#                closing, addLF to add a linefeed if the app doesn't, cp:<codepage number>
#                to perform codepage translation, i.e. cp:437
#              for printer:
#                printer still has it's own configuration section above.

#        biosps2: Emulate BIOS INT 15h PS/2 mouse services
#                 Note that some OS's like Microsoft Windows neither use INT 33h nor
#                 probe the AUX port directly and depend on this BIOS interface exclusively
#                 for PS/2 mouse support. In other cases there is no harm in leaving this enabled

# macaddr: The physical address the emulator will use on your network.
#          If you have multiple DOSBoxes running on your network,
#          this has to be changed for each. AC:DE:48 is an address range reserved for
#          private use, so modify the last three number blocks.
#          I.e. AC:DE:48:88:99:AB.
# realnic: Specifies which of your network interfaces is used.
#          Write 'list' here to see the list of devices in the
#          Status Window. Then make your choice and put either the
#          interface number (2 or something) or a part of your adapters
